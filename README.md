What is Cerberus?
----------------

Cerberus (CBS) is a cryptocurrency – a form of digital currency secured and issued by a cryptographic process. Cerberus code is based on DASH further introducing InstantSend and PrivateSend transactions, as well as Masternode technology supporting network stability, providing extra services to the network and rewarding Masternode holders (varying 50-75% of the block reward).
Cerberus uses Neoscrypt as a Proof of Work algorithm utilized by Graphics Processing Units (GPU), which ensures decentralization by eliminating ASIC hardware from the network. As a result CBS is evenly distributed and available for everyone.
